# Welcome!
### Information
This does not install like a normal homebridge plugin because I am very new to this. I'll look into it, though.

[All credit to the original homebridge-sengled, save for my small additions.](https://github.com/j796160836/homebridge-sengled)

### Requirements
- This tutorial is written for Windows, although outside of directories it should work the same on other platforms.
  - My homebridge install is on a Windows PC, sorry!
- homebridge-sengled already installed and set up

### Installing
Download config.js and index.js.
Open Windows+R, type %AppData%/Roaming/npm/npm_modules/homebridge-sengled and press enter.
Replace the existing index.js with the one you just downloaded from here.
Open lib/ and replace client.js with the one you just downloaded from here.
